# Dynamic programming to combinatorial problems
## Problem 1
Given number N. Calculate how many combinations with N signs possible combine from 1 and 0.
Constraints:
 - Should always start with 1
 - Avoid two digit 1 in series
 
 Examples:
  - for n = 1, possible only 1 combination - '1'
  - for n = 3, possible 3 combinations - '10', '11'
  - for n = 4, possible 3 combinations - '1000', '1001', '1010'
  
  
## Problem 2
    All the same with problem 1, but you should avoid three digit 1 in series
